## Overview
This is a short description of the PID controlled pendulum project. The project illustrates several concepts of real-world PID controllers, that theoretical descriptions often disregard. At the moment this includes

- bounded controller output
- limited controller speed
- controller measurement imprecision
- incomplete system information

Additional features will be added in the future.

## Build Sources and Documentation
Make sure to install the following dependencies with Python 3 (might require `pip3` on your system) if you want to build documentation or use the web server:

- `pip install flask` for the web app
- `pip install flake8` for linting
- `pip install sphinx` for all documentation

You might also need:
- `LaTeX` for creating PDF documentation

Then, run:

```bash
pip3 install PID-pendulum # install the PID_pendulum package
make # show a list of documentation formats, e.g. `make latexpdf` creates PDF docs
```

You can now import the pendulum in your code as follows:

```python
from PID_pendulum.PID_control import Pendulum, PIDControl
# see documentation for pendulum and controller methods
```

The file `debug.py` contains examples for the usage of the Pendulum and AnimatedPendulum classes. To check basic features of the current build version, type `make doctest`.

## Web API and Demonstration
An online demonstration of the PID pendulum controller implementation is [available here](https://pid-pendulum-demo.herokuapp.com/). To run the web app locally though, type:

```bash
cd api
flask run # now, visit localhost:5000 in a web browser
```

If the webserver is running, API requests can be send to the route `/api/v1`. The following script demonstrates that:

```bash
cd utils
./req_api.sh # performs an API request with valid parameters
./req_api.sh err # performs an API request with invalid parameters
```

The API returns a `json` object with two arrays containing the function and support values that correspond to the user-provided arguments.
