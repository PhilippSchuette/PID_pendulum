# PID pendulum controller
## Overview
This is a short description of the PID controlled pendulum project. The project illustrates several concepts of real-world PID controllers, that theoretical descriptions often disregard. At the moment this includes

- bounded controller output,

- limited controller speed,

- controller measurement imprecision,

- incomplete system information.

Many additional features will be added in the future.
